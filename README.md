# odin-recipes
The project is to make a webpage of recipes which is then linked to different pages for the different recipes. 
It requires working with images. 
Also i did a lot of 'cp htmlfile1 htmlfile2'  to save time. 
To make the webpages look better and not-lopsided i learned to center image and text(not completely - it was not the html way but the css waywhich i am yet to learn).

ps- still don't understand add, commit ,push completely(i,ll look at those again.)
